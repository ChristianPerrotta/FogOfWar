<h1>Fog of War</h1>
<p><i>Fog of War</i> is a classic minesweeper game, but remade using visual elements from the Fire Emblem franchise, more specifically the first 8 games. Simply choose a difficulty and a "style" (which will reflect in tilesets from different games) and you'll begin a short journey of 5 chapter until the end of the game.</p>
